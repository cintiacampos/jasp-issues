Dear all,

For the Exploratory Factorial Analysis and the Principal Component Analysis, I would like to know if it's possible to show the object values obtained for each observation.

I also would like to know, if there is some expectation to include as a factor analysis option the non-linear principal component analysis or CATPCA (categorial principal component analysis)

The pie plot is nothing working for me. The image appears cropped.

Thank you, 

best,

Cintia
